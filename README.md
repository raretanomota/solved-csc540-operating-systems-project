CSC540 Operating Systems Project (100 points)The purpose of this project is to write a program (use any programming language) that simulates an operating system.The program implements the following CPU scheduling algorithms.1. First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS)2. Shortest-Job-First (SJF)The program will read process burst times from a file (job.txt) – this file will be provided by the instructor.A sample input file of four jobs is given as follows (burst time in ms).:[Begin of job.txt]Job16Job24Job310Job47[End of job.txt]Note: You can assume that(1) there are no more than 30 jobs in the input file (job.txt).(2) processes arrive in the order they are read from the file for FCFS.(3) all jobs arrive at time 0 for SJF.Compare the average completion times of all jobs for each scheduling algorithm.Output the details of each algorithm’s execution. You need to show which jobs are selected at whattimes as well as their starting and stopping burst values. You can choose your display format,but it is recommended that you display the results in terms of a Gantt chart.
